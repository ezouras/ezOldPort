1/ Decided to create the SVG circles using
javascript.  this allows me to
tinker with the size of the circles and the number
of the circles depending on the window size.

2/ animations were to tedious.  each cricle
needed to go thru an animation and instead of creating
a new animation for each circle
I decided to use Sass to help wiht the
funtionality:
sass --watch input.scss style.css
sass input.scss style.css
